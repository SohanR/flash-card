# My Boilerplate

This is my-boilerplate that i use everytime to build project.

## Building and running on localhost

First install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm start
```

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build-prod
```

To create a development build:

```sh
npm run build-dev
```
